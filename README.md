# Website-URL-Shortener
Long URLs aren't very aesthetically pleasing. Hence, this web application shortens URLs and allows user to customize the subdirectory of the shortened link. The application is built using Python and Flask. Database management is done using SQL Alchemy. Front-end features are built using bootstrap.
